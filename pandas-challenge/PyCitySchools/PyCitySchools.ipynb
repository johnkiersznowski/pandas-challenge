    "PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis observes data related to a school district's schools, budgets, student demographics, and student's scores. The data included 15 different high-schools containing just under 40,000 students. Of the most substance was comparing the math and reading scores of students based on relevant variables such as school spending, school size, as well as school type. Two interesting observable trends based on the data are explored below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The most noticeable observation for me is the correlation between scores by school size. The overall passing percentage was measured for students who score at least 70% on both reading and math scores and this was compared to a number of variables. Intuitively, schools with a large budget would be capable for more opportunities and teaching applications. Surprisingly there was a distinct inverse relationship found between the percentage of overall passing and school spending (per student) as it were categorized by ranges. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another significant observation is correlation between percentage students passed overall with the type of school students attended. There existed an almost even eight schools of the 15 that were charter, while the remaining seven were district type. Charter schools reported 90.4% overall passing while district only had 53.7%. This observation is interesting and calls for further investigation into more detailed variables surrounding the type of school and how they might lead to such a drastic gap between student scores."
